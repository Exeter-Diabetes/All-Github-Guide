# A naming convention guide
This file explains the naming convention used throughout this organization
1. Find your way around the repositories!
2. Understand how to correctly create new, visible repositories for your peers
3. Implement correct formatting for any forking and branching

## Typical Naming convention
Dataset-Author-Purpose
Eg. StartRight-Ethan-Scripts

1. Dataset refers to the reference dataset that the repository is targetted to
   * If repository does not have a target dataset, or a dataset does not apply, please see _Exceptions_ section
   * If dataset is one word, the full word is used, if the dataset is multiple words, an abbreviation of the first letters should be used.

2. Author refers to the creator of the repository and the lead developer of the content of the repository
   * If repository contains collaborative and widely relevant information, please see _Exceptions_ section
   * Author should be referred to by first name only

3. Purpose refers to the type of content that is contained within the repository
   * Common practice is to separate _SCRIPTS_ and _SUPPLEMENTARY_ content
   * A "General" purpose can be used for repositories with little and diverse content


## Exceptions
1. This repository is an exception to the naming convention
   * 'All' has been placed foremost so that it appears as the first repository when viewing the organization

2. Repository has no target dataset
   * This can occur when an informative, or non-project related repository is required
   * When a dataset is not relevant, the first section of the typical naming convention should be replaced with a concise, PascalCase word (or abbreviation) regarding the relevant event
      * eg. DUK-Ethan-General

3. Repository has multiple essential authors
   * This can occur when a large project requires multiple collaborators working together on one script
   * A lead should be nominated, and their first name should come first, followed by the secondary collaborator's first name only separated by an underscore
      * eg. Github-Laura_Ethan-Presentation

4. Repository content is essential for all members of organization, not just one author
   * Used for any general-info repository, like this repository 
   * The "All" keyword can be used instead of crediting the creator/lead author
      * eg. Github-All-Workshop
