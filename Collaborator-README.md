# All-Github-Guide
## A guide on using this Github organization for any newcomers!

### Why a Github organization?
1. Github is an excellent version control and collaboration platform
2. Having one centralised organization allows collaborators to work more efficiently with more structured code and project management
3. An organization can be managed more simply than having several independant github repositories, and it simplifies interacting with large singular repositories by breaking them down into more bite-size collaborations!
