# A guide on using this Github organization for any newcomers!

## Why a Github organization?
1. Github is an excellent version control and collaboration platform - allowing the Exeter Diabetes team to centralise their code in one place.
2. Github allows you to create a stable branch of your code so that you have a permanent link to reference for Research papers, all the while working and updating your code in the same place!
3. An organization can be managed more simply than having several independant github repositories, and it simplifies interacting with large singular repositories by breaking them down into more bite-size collaborations!
